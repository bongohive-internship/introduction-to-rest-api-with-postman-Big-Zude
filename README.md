Instead of mocking our created Node JS express  APIs using the browser, you will learn how to use postman. 

getting started

1. Download and install postman from postman website. Make sure to download the one that is compatible with your Operating System https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/

3. Run through the getting started tutorial on the link to see how to mock APIs with postman https://learning.getpostman.com/getting-started/

4. To sharpen the skills in postman, we will use already existing apis from Json Placeholder website. Go to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com scroll to routes section and click on the first posts link. This will open the link in another tab were you can copy the route from the URL which you can use in postman.The links have already been copied in the next section of this course.

5. Go back to postman, open it if you had closed it. In the url section in postman paste the following links
 - Get https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
 - Get https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
 - Get https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments
 - Get https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
